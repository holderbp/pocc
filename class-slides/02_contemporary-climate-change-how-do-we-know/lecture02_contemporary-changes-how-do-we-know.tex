\begin{itemize}
\item Average annual temperatures are significantly different at the gulf coast and the border with Oklahoma!
\item Temperature anomalies are taken in reference to some chosen average value (here: 1980--2010).
\item That reference point is always {\em local}: Each location has an anomaly with respect to its average reference point.

\begin{itemize}
\item What does the comparison of human $\text{CO}_2$ production (line on left graph) and annual atmospheric increase (bars) tell us?
\item \underline{Combustion} is: $\text{C}_x \text{H}_y  + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{H}_2 \text{O} + \text{CO}_2$
